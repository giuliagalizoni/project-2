# Wasthere - share your travels with the world. 

**Welcome to [Wasthere](https://wasthere.netlify.app/)!**

This app was developed for educational purposes at Ironhack FullStack Web Development Bootcamp by [Giulia Galizoni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giulia-galizoni-caversan-84b481112/) & [Junior Vilarino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/junior-vilarino/).

## What is Wasthere?

Wasthere is a social blog focused on travel experiences. In the app, you can create posts sharing your views about places you have visited: tourists spots, restaurants, or anywhere you believe the world should (or shouldn't) see. You can also rate this experience and add a description to let everybody know what are your thoughts about it, as well as like and comment on other posts.
